## How it works?
<p>When launching, xdotool takes the mouse position, if the mouse moves, then the script is launched, blocking any attempt, displaying an image in large screen then sleep the mac 15s after.</p>


### Need:
U will need xdotool to launch this script, to download xdotool with brew go on your terminal then type :
```bash
brew install xquartz
brew install xdotool
```

### Install lock:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hadrienaka/lock
./lock/lock
```
You need to change the image who will be in the full screen mode on the lock script
